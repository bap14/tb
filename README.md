# Tb, the Twitch Chat "Bouncer"

#### It powers [Tc, the Twitch chat client](http://gettc.xyz/) ðŸ˜Š

### Demo
[backlog.gettc.xyz/v1/itshafu](https://backlog.gettc.xyz/v1/itshafu)

### API

`/:channel` - Where channel is a twitch username.  

Query parameters:  
`after` - Get messages after this timestamp in milliseconds. Default: one hour ago  
`before`: Get messages before this timestamp in milliseconds. Default: now  
`limit`: Only grab up to this many messages, removing older ones first. Default: 30

Requirements:
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Port 6255 available

### Message format
`{user, message, at}` - Where `at` is a timestamp in milliseconds.

```javascript
// A request will produce an array of these
{
  user: {
    badges: "moderator/1",
    color: "#FF0000",
    display-name: "YuukiHatsu",
    emotes: {
      354: [
        "21-25"
      ]
    },
    mod: true,
    room-id: "30777889",
    subscriber: false,
    turbo: false,
    user-id: "51320169",
    user-type: "mod",
    emotes-raw: "354:21-25",
    username: "yuukihatsu",
    message-type: "chat"
  },
  message: "no, imma watch strim 4Head",
  at: 1462385825967
},
```

### Setup and usage
It's currently not very customizable, sorry.

- Make sure MongoDB is up and running, it will use the `/tb` database
- Clone repo
- Cd into it
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`

Tb now handles requests at `http://localhost:6255/v1`. Set up your reverse proxy however you see fit.
